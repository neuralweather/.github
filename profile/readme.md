## Neural Weather - Delivering blockchain deep neural IOT weather performance.

Code for a weather station ~~written as a school project~~ which will revolutionize the world of IOT, blockchain and AI.

Currently, there is no actual AI nor anything related to blockchains, but it sure sounds good (at least that's what the marketing department says).
